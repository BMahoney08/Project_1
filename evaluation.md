# Project Feedback + Evaluation

## Project Workflow

>Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

**Meets expectations**: Nicely-detailed readme, and nice user stories. Normally I harp on people for having bad commit messages, but those are fairly descriptive as well. I'd challenge you to add in wireframes next time, and to try using the scrum methodology with icebox/backlog/current/etc. Not only does this generally improve the quality of the product; it's extremely compelling to prospective employers.

That said, you mentioned getting too caught up in the planning process, so no need to make that your priority just now.

## Technical Requirements

>Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**Exceeds expectations**: You make use of some neat stuff in here. I was surprised to see you using audio, and especially cookies!

## Code Quality

>Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

**Meets expectations**: In general, your code looks very good. The biggest change I'd like to see is moving all of your functions to the end of your file, and relying on hoisting. Generally, it's good practice to keep all of your variables and functions in one place, and all of your "flow" -- where stuff is actually happening -- in another.

## Problem Solving

>Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

**Exceeds expectations**: Really nicely done, Brendan! It's clear that you have a solid grasp of event listeners, jQuery selectors, and DOM traversal, and are exploring methods of keeping your code as efficient as possible. I'll look forward to seeing how Object-Oriented Programming treats you.

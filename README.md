First web application I completed starting from scratch. Still fun to look back on.

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery were all used to create the "Learn the Command Line" flashcards web application. HTML was used create the elements of the web application, e.g., the flashard and the stat tracker. JavaScript was used to build the functionality of the web application, and used in conjunction with jQuery to manipulate elements of the DOM, e.g., the flashcard flipping over. A CSS stylesheet was created for the styling of the website, and a couple of google font's stylesheets were used to access fonts used in the web application, e.g., the font that appears handwritten on the flashcard.

I would still like to add swiping functionality, that allows the user to swipe their trackpad/cursor to the right for correct answers and left for incorrect answers. I also want to add an animation that makes the flashcard move off the page either right or left, dependent on whether the user got the answer correct or incorrect. As well as a cookie that tracks the users incorrect and correct scores over time.

User Stories:

1 - As a User, I should be able to access the web application, in order to make use of its functionality.

2 - As a User, I should be able to read both sides of flash card, so that I can learn from them.

3 - As a User, I should be able to access the deck of flashcards again, after all cards have been scrolled through, in order to read through them again without having to refresh the webpage.

4 - As a User, I should be able to cycle through the flashcards.

5 - As a User, I should be able to cycle through only the flashcards that I did not answer correctly.
